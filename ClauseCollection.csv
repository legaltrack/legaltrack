As defined in the NERC Glossary. 5. Compliance Enforcement Authority. As defined in the NERC Rules of Procedure. 6. Covered Data. Synchrophasor Data, Operating Reliability Data, Remedial Action Scheme Data, and Transmission Network Model Data, whether or not “real time, ” and Derived Information, including such data or information obtained under the 2012 UDSA or the Bridge Data Sharing Policy. Covered Data does not include data or information that: a. Prior to its receipt under this Agreement, the 2012 UDSA or the Bridge Data Sharing Policy and evidenced by a Party’s written records, was (i) already in that Party's possession without restriction on disclosure, or (ii) obtained from a third party legally free to disclose such information; b. Is otherwise available from a public source; c. Was developed by a Party independent of any disclosure made under this Agreement, as evidenced by that Party’s written records; d. Is disclosed without restriction to a third party by the Original Data Provider; or e. Is aggregated or masked (not including Synchrophasor Data) to a point that would not allow the Covered Data to be identified as related to a specific Party. 7. Critical Data. Data that, if released, could be used in conjunction with other types of data to significantly degrade the Bulk Electric System. 8. Critical Energy Infrastructure Information. Specific engineering, or detailed design information about proposed or existing critical infrastructure (physical or virtual) that: a.

Because Derived Information is included in the definition of Covered Data, it is to be considered, treated, and protected as such. Data or analysis that has been sufficiently aggregated or masked (except Synchrophasor Data) so that no Original Data Provider's Covered Data can be identified, such as data included in Peak performance metrics, is not considered Derived Information. In addition, any information or analyses derived from the Covered Data supplied by an Original Data Provider (or specified group of Original Data Providers) is not Derived Information if the Original Data Provider (s) authorizes disclosure of such information or analyses. 12.
